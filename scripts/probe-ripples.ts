/**
 * Asserts the ripple constants match, across ripples.ts and every geometric
 * shader — docs/todo.md entry 59.
 *
 * `MAX_RIPPLES` and `AUDIO_RIPPLES` are declared once in `ripples.ts` and
 * copied by hand into every geometric shader, which has no way to import a
 * JS constant. Fourteen declarations of two facts, kept in step only by a
 * comment asking nicely. If `ripples.ts` disagrees with a shader in either
 * direction, one view silently misbehaves: an array uploaded larger than
 * the shader's own `uniform vec4[N]` gets truncated by the driver, or a
 * shader reading past what was actually written reads garbage — five views
 * look right and the sixth reads as an unrelated quirk, which is exactly
 * the failure that survives ordinary testing.
 *
 * Reads the shaders as text and matches a regex rather than compiling
 * them, so this runs under plain Node beside every other probe here — no
 * GL context, no browser.
