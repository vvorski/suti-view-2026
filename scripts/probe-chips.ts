/**
 * Offline check of the HUD's chip arcs — docs/todo.md entry 119.
 *
 * The bug this exists for could only be seen at a viewport nobody had looked
 * at: on every landscape size the last chip on the outer ring was placed
 * above the top of the screen, so it existed, was wired, and could not be
 * tapped. `resize_window` lies about the viewport and `hud.ts` cannot be
 * imported headlessly at all, so the geometry moved to `chip-arc.ts` and this
 * scrubs it directly — every aspect ratio in a few milliseconds, rather than
 * four sizes somebody thought to try.
