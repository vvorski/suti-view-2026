/**
 * The two view registries — geometric and atmospheric — that scene.ts
 * composites together every frame.
 *
 * Every view shares the same uniforms and the same fullscreen vertex shader,
 * so a view is nothing but a fragment shader plus a label. That constraint is
 * deliberate: it means scene.ts never learns anything about what a particular
 * view does, and adding one is a file plus a line here.
 *
 * The split into two registries is deliberate too. Geometric views are
 * discrete-event things (a ring born on a hit); atmospheric views are
 * continuous fields (noise, spectrograms, envelopes). Nothing stops a future
 * view from blurring that line, but the two are picked independently in the
 * control panel and composited rather than switched between, so they need
 * separate defaults and separate URL params.
 *
 * Switching recompiles a shader (tens of milliseconds). That is fine for a
 * deliberate choice from the control panel and would not be fine per frame.
