/**
 * A new picture, graded by how hard the shake that asked for it was.
 *
 * `depth` is the 0-1 scale shake.ts's `intensity()` computes from a peak —
 * see docs/todo.md entry 15. Every rung includes the ones below it, ordered
 * by how little of what you had survives: a colour shift is recognisably the
 * same picture, a view change is a different instrument.
 *
 *   any qualifying shake   both layers' colours and opacities *nudge*
 *                          (this function only — see entry 35)
 *   0.30                   colours and opacities *re-roll* from scratch,
 *                          + re-seed (the caller's own job — see shuffle())
 *   0.45                   + both merge modes
 *   0.70                   + both views
 *   0.90                   + opacity re-rolls again (span, not nudge),
 *                          mapping, the camera layer's colour
 *
 * Colours used to have no threshold check at all, which sounds the same as
 * "always" but is not: the *re-seed* was what actually had no threshold
 * (`shuffle()` called `visualiser.randomise()` unconditionally, outside
 * every depth test below), and a re-seed replaces the arrangement entirely
 * while keeping only the palette and the view — the biggest change the
 * ladder can make, sitting where the smallest one belongs. Entry 29 gives
 * the re-seed its own threshold (`SHUFFLE_RESEED`, 0.30 — above the old
 * colour boundary, so a shake that used to re-seed silently now shifts the
 * palette instead) and puts colours at the true bottom of the ladder.
 *
 * A full re-roll is still the biggest change *that* rung can make, though —
 * nothing of the palette survives it. Entry 35 makes the true bottom rung a
 * *perturbation* instead: below SHUFFLE_RESEED, `geoColour`, `atmColour`,
 * `geoAlpha` and `atmAlpha` each move a little from their current value
 * (`current`, below) rather than being replaced, so the gentlest qualifying
 * shake shifts the picture you have rather than handing you a different
 * one. The full re-roll moves up to join the re-seed at SHUFFLE_RESEED,
 * which is the one rung it was always meant to share — nothing of the
 * palette surviving is exactly what a re-seed already does to everything
 * else.
 *
 * Opacity and mapping were excluded entirely when this was a single on/off
 * shuffle (entry 6) — opacity because a shuffle that can hand back a black
 * screen looks like a crash recoverable only by shaking at nothing, mapping
 * because it is how the picture *hears*, not what it looks like. Both are
 * back at the top rung: opacity floored at 0.5 (raised from an initial 0.35
 * by entry 21, once the *product* of opacity and colour turned out to be
 * what actually goes dark — see SHUFFLE_MIN_ALPHA's own comment) rather than
 * spanning 0-1, and mapping because at the top of the scale the ask is a
 * genuinely different instrument, not a different palette — overturning
 * entry 6's exclusion on purpose rather than by oversight.
 *
 * The camera may also be raised at the top rung — see maybeRollCamera()
 * below. This overturns what this comment used to say, and what entries 6
 * and 15 both said: that the camera could never be switched on by a
 * shuffle, "not a taste call, the capture hard stop." Licensed by Victor
 * 2026-08-29 (entry 22), narrowly: only at the top rung, only sometimes, and
 * only where permission was already granted — a `devicemotion` event
 * carries no user activation, so this can raise the level but never itself
 * ask for the camera the first time. **That last clause is still true of
 * this path and is no longer true of every path**: docs/todo.md entry 121
 * adds a shake *with a finger already on the glass*, where the finger's own
 * `pointerdown` supplies the activation this one lacks, and which therefore
 * may open the camera for the first time. See `maybeRaiseCameraOnPress`. `shuffled()` itself is unchanged by
 * this; the roll lives in `maybeRollCamera()` because it needs an async
 * permission check this function cannot make.
 *
 * A field is present only when its rung is reached, so `Hud.adopt()`'s
 * "only touch what's given" guards do the rest — a shuffle that doesn't
 * reach mapping must never re-create the live Mapping instance and discard
 * its envelope state for nothing.
