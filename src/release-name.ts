/**
 * Every name this release chip has ever carried, oldest first.
 *
 * The build number answers "is this newer than what I had"; it cannot answer
 * "is this the one with the camera in it", and that is the question actually
 * being asked when someone is looking at a phone across a room. Consecutive
 * integers are also genuinely hard to tell apart at a glance — most of a long
 * session spent hunting a deploy went into establishing that the screen said
 * 22 rather than 45, which a name would have settled instantly.
 *
 * Two words, lowercase, evocative rather than descriptive. Descriptive names
 * go stale the moment the release after them changes the same thing; a name
 * only has to be memorable and distinct from its neighbours.
 *
 * Keep it under about 18 characters. The chip is set large on purpose — it is
 * meant to be read at arm's length from a propped-up phone — so a long name is
 * the one thing that can crowd a 320px screen. The size clamps down to fit
 * rather than truncating, but a short name gets the full size. It is also the
 * width `index.html` reserves for the release-name flip (docs/todo.md entry
 * 55, `#release-name`'s own `min-width: 18ch`) — a name past this ceiling is
 * the one thing that can make that flip reflow.
 *
 * Appended in the same commit as the work it names, not changed —
 * docs/todo.md entry 55. Every commit that reaches main deploys, so every
 * commit that reaches main adds a line here. An append cannot silently lose
 * the previous name the way an edit once could; the list itself is what entry
 * 55's load animation runs through, oldest to newest, before settling on
 * `RELEASE_NAME` below. Recovered once, in full, from `git log --follow` —
 * the seed data below is not invented, it is what actually shipped.
